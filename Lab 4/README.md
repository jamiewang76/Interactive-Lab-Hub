# Ph-UI!!!

**Jamie Wang, Yunfei Jiao**


For lab this week, we focus both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 

## Part 1 Lab Preparation

### Get the latest content:
As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo. As we discussed in the class, there are 2 ways you can do so:


**\[recommended\]**Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the personal access token for this.
```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2022
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab4 content"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, [create pull request](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md) to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have latest updates online, go on your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull` to get updates from your own GitHub repo.

Option 3: (preferred) use the Github.com interface to update the changes.

### Start brainstorming ideas by reading: 

* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 
* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 
* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

## The Report (Part 1: A-D, Part 2: E-F)

### Part A
### Capacitive Sensing, a.k.a. Human-Twizzler Interaction 

We want to introduce you to the [capacitive sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) in your kit. It's one of the most flexible input devices we are able to provide. At boot, it measures the capacitance on each of the 12 contacts. Whenever that capacitance changes, it considers it a user touch. You can attach any conductive material. In your kit, you have copper tape that will work well, but don't limit yourself! In the example below, we use Twizzlers--you should pick your own objects.


<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/guides/cropped_images/000/003/226/medium640/MPR121_top_angle.jpg?1609282424" height="150" />
 
</p>

Plug in the capacitive sensor board with the QWIIC connector. Connect your Twizzlers with either the copper tape or the alligator clips (the clips work better). Install the latest requirements from your working virtual environment:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/679721816318803975/823299613812719666/PXL_20210321_205742253.jpg" width=400>
These Twizzlers are connected to pads 6 and 10. When you run the code and touch a Twizzler, the terminal will print out the following

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python cap_test.py 
Twizzler 10 touched!
Twizzler 6 touched!
```

### Part B
### More sensors

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)

We here want you to get to know this awesome sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595). It is capable of sensing proximity, light (also RGB), and gesture! 
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>
 

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the three example scripts individually to see what the sensor is capable of doing!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python proximity_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python gesture_test.py
...
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python color_test.py
...
```

You can go the the [Adafruit GitHub Page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_APDS9960) to see more examples for this sensor!

#### Rotary Encoder (optional)

> **_NOTE:_**  Not in the kit yet - skip this.

A rotary encoder is an electro-mechanical device that converts the angular position to analog or digital output signals. The [Adafruit rotary encoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4991#technical-details) we ordered for you came with separate breakout board and encoder itself, that is, they will need to be soldered if you have not yet done so! We will be bringing the soldering station to the lab class for you to use, also, you can go to the MakerLAB to do the soldering off-class. Here is some [guidance on soldering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/preparation) from Adafruit. When you first solder, get someone who has done it before (ideally in the MakerLAB environment). It is a good idea to review this material beforehand so you know what to look at.

```

You can go to the [Adafruit Learn Page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-i2c-qt-rotary-encoder/python-circuitpython) to learn more about the sensor! The sensor actually comes with an LED (neo pixel): Can you try lighting it up? 

#### Joystick (optional)


A [joystick](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15168) can be used to sense and report the input of the stick for it pivoting angle or direction. It also comes with a button input!

<p float="left">

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python joystick_test.py
```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Joystick_Py) to learn more about the sensor!

#### Distance Sensor


Earlier we have asked you to play with the proximity sensor, which is able to sense objects within a short distance. Here, we offer [Sparkfun Proximity Sensor Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15177), With the ability to detect objects up to 20cm away.

<p float="left">

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector and try running the example script to see how it works!

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python qwiic_distance.py
```

You can go to the [SparkFun GitHub Page](https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_Proximity_Py) to learn more about the sensor and see other examples

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing


Usually, sensors need to be positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.


**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

1. Install distance detectors along the sides of street curbs to sense passing vehicles. Each time a vehicle passes by, the detector will emit a signal.
   ![WechatIMG3257](https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/8f2969e8-9d39-4c3f-aaa9-9db0123d6299)

   
2. Employ a pair of rotary encoders to replicate the functionality of a radio's dial buttons. The encoders detect angular positions, allowing for precise adjustments of both volume and frequency settings to the desired numerical values.
   ![WechatIMG3258](https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/5c213b71-7eaf-493a-8529-b8a657e1c55e)


3. Utilize capacitive sensors affixed to the rims of snack bags to register touches with hands. These signals will be accumulated daily, displayed on the pi monitor to alert the user how many times they were eating snacks on that day.
<img width="846" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-11 at 10 57 04 PM" src="https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/29d69ac7-d0b0-4b52-9ec9-523b20ca7231">

4. Use distance detectors for detecting the proximity of a person to the shower head. When the person is detected approaching the shower head, the shower head will be automatically activated. Conversely, when the person moves away, the system will promptly deactivate the shower head, conserving water and energy.
![WechatIMG3260](https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/80919942-6cef-4260-98da-d18d1d80950d)

5. Adding distance detectors inside trash cans to monitor trash bag fullness. These detectors measure the distance between the top of the trash and the top of the bag.
![WechatIMG3261](https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/25aee456-6e3f-4c84-b4d8-aebdd2a3ad59)


**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***

1. Place distance detectors on the side of street curbs to detect cars passing by. Whenever a car passes by, a signal will be sent from the detector.
   - Questions
      - How accurately can the sensor detect the car's presence and distance?
      - Could the system distract drivers or disrupt traffic flow?
   - What to physically prototype
      - Need to simulate the system and test its accuracy in detecting passing cars under various conditions and conduct safety assessments and consider how to minimize distractions or potential hazards.
1. Using two rotary encoders to simulate a radio’s dial buttons.The angular positions are detected to change the volume and frequency to the right number. 
   - Questions
      - What is the range and sensitivity of the volume control?
      - How can we ensure accurate and reliable gesture recognition?
      - Any feedback mechanisms (e.g., LED indicators, audio cues) to confirm user actions?
   - What to physically prototype
      - Need to set up rotary actuators and create a mechanism to control the radio's volume using these actuators.
      - Create a user-friendly interface and feedback system that allows users to interact with the radio easily and understand the status of volume and channel selection.

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***
<img width="854" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-11 at 10 56 29 PM" src="https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/b640ed3e-db38-497d-bb72-86175acfde5d">


### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts



Here is a Pi with a paper faceplate on it to turn it into a display interface:


<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/paper_if.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


This is fine, but the mounting of the display constrains the display location and orientation a lot. Also, it really only works for applications where people can come and stand over the Pi, or where you can mount the Pi to the wall.

Here is another prototype for a paper display:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/b_box.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>


Your kit includes these [SparkFun Qwiic OLED screens](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153). These use less power than the MiniTFTs you have mounted on the GPIO pins of the Pi, but, more importantly, they can be more flexibly mounted elsewhere on your physical interface. The way you program this display is almost identical to the way you program a  Pi display. Take a look at `oled_test.py` and some more of the [Adafruit examples](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples).

<p float="left">
<img src="https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/6/1/3/5/17153-SparkFun_Qwiic_OLED_Display__0.91_in__128x32_-01.jpg" height="200" />

</p>


It holds a Pi and usb power supply, and provides a front stage on which to put writing, graphics, LEDs, buttons or displays.

This design can be made by scoring a long strip of corrugated cardboard of width X, with the following measurements:

| Y height of box <br> <sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Z  depth of box <br><sub><sup>- thickness of cardboard</sup></sub> | Y height of box  | Z  depth of box | H height of faceplate <br><sub><sup>* * * * * (don't make this too short) * * * * *</sup></sub>|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 

Fold the first flap of the strip so that it sits flush against the back of the face plate, and tape, velcro or hot glue it in place. This will make a H x X interface, with a box of Z x X footprint (which you can adapt to the things you want to put in the box) and a height Y in the back. 

Here is an example:

<img src="https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2020Fall/images/horoscope.png?raw=true"  width="250"/>

Think about how you want to present the information about what your sensor is sensing! Design a paper display for your project that communicates the state of the Pi and a sensor. Ideally you should design it so that you can slide the Pi out to work on the circuit or programming, and then slide it back in and reattach a few wires to be back in operation.
 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***
<img width="1235" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-11 at 11 29 36 PM" src="https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/3956e248-bd2f-4359-a5dc-515aa91688c8">

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***
1. The digital display is flat, but some of the surfaces we want to attach it to are not flat. Physical prototype is needed to test if the display can be securely fixated on a unflat surface.
2. The copper tape may easily entangle each other, which could limit the number of the items that can be attached to. We need physical prototype to see how to make things more organized.

**\*\*\*Pick one of these display designs to integrate into your prototype.\*\*\***
<img width="1031" alt="Screen Shot 2023-10-11 at 11 05 31 PM" src="https://github.com/Yunfei-J/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/142849884/dd42d8b3-2fa7-45ce-a1d8-9e9e6a2a75ba">

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design.\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)

Build a cardboard prototype of your design.

The size doesn't have to be big because the display is what matters. But since the screens we could use are small, we want to connect the webcam to utilize its speaker to read the information out so that the person interacting with it doesn't necessarily need to receive the information visually.

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***
The capacitive sensor is connected to the pi, and each contact will be linked to a bag of snack. When a snack bag is touched, the number on the display will increment by 1.

Since the most crucial information in the device is the number of times that snacks were opened, to maximize its font size on the display, we wrote every other words on the 'costume' of pi.

The buttons on the MiniTFTs can be used for resetting the number to zero.

A webcam will be later connected to the pi to produce audio output with its speaker.


LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.

### Part E (Optional)
### Servo Control with Joystick

> **_NOTE:_**  Not in the kit yet.

In the class kit, you should be able to find the [Qwiic Servo Controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16773) and [Micro Servo Motor SG51](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201). The Qwiic Servo Controller will need external power supply to drive, which is included in your kit. Connect the servo controller to the miniPiTFT through qwiic connector and connect the external battery to the 2-Pin JST port (ower port) on the servo controller. Connect your servo to channel 2 on the controller, make sure the brown is connected to GND and orange is connected to PWM.


<img src="Servo_Setup.jpg" width="400"/>

In this exercise, we will be using the nice [ServoKit library](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/python-circuitpython) developed by Adafruit! We will continue to use the `circuitpython` virtual environment we created. Activate the virtual environment and make sure to install the latest required libraries by running:

```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

A servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position. The position of a servo motor is set by the width of an electrical pulse, that is, we can use PWM (pulse-width modulation) to set and control the servo motor position. You can read [this](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-14-servo-motors/servo-motors) to learn a bit more about how exactly a servo motor works.


Now that you have a basic idea of what a servo motor is, look into the script `servo_test.py` we provide. In line 14, you should see that we have set up the min_pulse and max_pulse corresponding to the servo turning 0 - 180 degrees. Try running the servo example code now and see what happens:


```
(circuitpython) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 4 $ python servo_test.py
```

It is also possible to control the servo using the sensors mentioned in as in part A and part B, and/or from some of the buttons or parts included in your kit, the simplest way might be to chain Qwiic buttons to the other end of the Qwiic OLED. Like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="chaining.png"  width="200" ></p>

You can then call whichever control you like rather than setting a fixed value for the servo. For more information on controlling Qwiic devices, Sparkfun has several python examples, such as [this](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-joystick-hookup-guide/all#python-examples).

We encourage you to try using these controls, **while** paying particular attention to how the interaction changes depending on the position of the controls. For example, if you have your servo rotating a screen (or a piece of cardboard) from one position to another, what changes about the interaction if the control is on the same side of the screen, or the opposite side of the screen? Trying and retrying different configurations generally helps reveal what a design choice changes about the interaction -- _make sure to document what you tried_!


### Part F (Optional)
### Camera
You can use the inputs and outputs from the video camera in the kit. 
We provide another script called camera_test.py to test the USB camera on raspberry pi. 
It uses qt to render a video to the screen, so it is necessary to connect a screen or to connect via VNC to run this script. 

First install some more dependencies into your virtual environment. OpenCV should already be installed on the Pi for the super user. 

```
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
pip install opencv-python pyaudio pygame
```

Once executed the script will render the camera output, press 'q' to stop video and record a sound through the microphone which will be played back by specificing the audio output. 

---
The video is rendered locally on the pi. For wizarding interactions and prototyping it can be necessary to stream the video to another device such as your laptop. A wizard, observing the user and acting as a computer vision algorithm, can then trigger interactions remotley, such as we did in the tinkerbelle lab.

The following resources are good starts on how to stream video: 
* [OpenCV – Stream video to web browser/HTML page](https://pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/02/opencv-stream-video-to-web-browser-html-page/)
* [Live video streaming over network with OpenCV and ImageZMQ](https://pyimagesearch.com/2019/04/15/live-video-streaming-over-network-with-opencv-and-imagezmq/)
### Part G

### Record

[![Chord Bot Video](https://github.com/jamiewang76/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2023/Lab%204/ChordBotCover.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xA8SuzQUipnl55eA44ywwiRdXi1b42PM/view?usp=share_link)

Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the device

* For part 2, we switched to a new design and we gave it the name "chord bot". Chord bot is an instrument that can play chords according to the the distance between the interacter's left and right palm.

* "Looks like": Chord bot has a body made from a juice box and wrapped in aluminum foil. Inside the body is where we hid the webcam. Chord bot also has a aluminumfoil-made head with a smiley face.
* "Works like": When the interacter stands/sits in front of Chord Bot, the bot recognizes the pose of the person, calculates the distance between the interacter's left and right palm/wrist. As the distance increases, Chord Bot plays a chord with higher pitch.
* "Acts like": The interacter needs to stand/sit at a distance from Chord Bot so that their face and upper body can be captured by Chord Bot's camera. Then the person could place their hands at different positions and explore what different chord Chord Bot would make. After they find out the pattern, they could compose a short piece of chord combination and execute it by planned gestures.
